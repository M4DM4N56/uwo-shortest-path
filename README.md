# uwo-shortest-path

This is a Western University project.

The files written by me are :
- DLPriorityQueue
- DLinkedNode
- FindShortestPath

This project makes use of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a hexagonal maze.
There are certain obstacles such as wall blocks and "dragon" blocks (dragon blocks stop the user from using the adjacent blocks).

This program makes use of the priority queue ADT.
